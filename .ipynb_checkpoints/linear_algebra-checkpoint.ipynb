    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics that allows you to concisely describe coordinates and interactions of planes in higher dimensions, as well as perform operations on them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as an extension of algebra into an arbitrary number of dimensions. Linear Algebra is about working on linear systems of equations. Rather than working with scalars, we work with matrices and vectors. This is particularly import to the study of computer science because vectors and matrices can be used to represent data of all forms - images, text, and of course, numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Learn Linear Algebra?\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Machine Learning</b>: A lot of Machine Learning concepts are tied to linear algebra concepts. Some basic examples, PCA - eigenvalue, regression - matrix multiplication. As most ML techniques deal with high dimensional data, they are often times represented as matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Mathematical Modeling</b>: for example, if you want to capture behaviors (sales, engagement, etc.) in a mathematical model, you can use matrices to breakdown the samples into their own subgroups. This requires some basic matrix manipulation, such as atrix inversion, derivation, solving partial differential, or first order differential equations with matrices, for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Scalars & Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see the terms scalar and vector throughout this course, so it's very important that we learn how to distinguish between the two. A scalar refers to the <b>magnitude</b> of an object. In contrast, a <i>vector</i> has <b>both</b> a magnitude and a <b>direction</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "An intuitive example is with respect to distance. If you drive 50 miles north, then the scalar value is `50`. Now, the vector that would represent this could be something like `(50, N)` which indicates to us both the direction <i>and</i> the magnitude. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons why the mathematics of Machine Learning is important and Iâ€™ll highlight some of them below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Selecting the right algorithm which includes giving considerations to accuracy, training time, model complexity, number of parameters and number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Choosing parameter settings and validation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Identifying underfitting and overfitting by understanding the Bias-Variance tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Estimating the right confidence interval and uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "&isin; refers to \"element in\". For example `2` &isin; `[1,2,3,4]` <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "&real; refers to the set of all real numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the [distance formula](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.norm.html) and [trigonometry functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) in Python, calculate the magnitude and direction of a line with the two coordinates, `(5,3)` and `(1,1)`.\n",

    "### What is a vector space?\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector space V is a set that contains all linear combinations of its elements. In other words, if you have a set A, the space vector V includes all combinations of the elements in A. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that said, there are three properties that <b>every</b> vector space must follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Additive Closure: If vectors u and v &isin; V, then u + v &isin; V <br>\n",
    "When we earlier stated that the vector space has all combinations of the elements in set A, one of the operations we meant by 'combinations' was <i>vector</i> addition. For example if we have two vectors in set A, let's say (4, 5) and (3, 1), then the vector space of A must have those two vectors, as well as the vector (4+3, 5+1), or `(7, 6)`. This has to be true for any two vectors in set A. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalar Closure: If u &isin; V, then &alpha; &middot; u must &isin; &Nu; for any scalar &alpha; <br>\n",
    "Recall that a scalar is a magnitude value with no direction, such as 5. For a vector space to be a vector space, that means for every vector in the original set A, that vector multiplied by any number (or constant or scalar) must be in the vector space V. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Additive Identity: There exists a &middot; 0 &isin; V such that u + 0 = u for any u &isin; V <br>\n",
    "In other words, the vector space of set A must contain the zero vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Additive Associativity: If u, v, w &isin; V, then u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w <br>\n",
    "Regardless of the order in which you add multiple vectors, their results should be the same\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Additive Inverse: If u &isin; V, then there exists a vector âˆ’u &isin; V so that u + (âˆ’u) = 0. <br>\n",
    "For example, if the vector (2, 3) &isin; V, then its additive inverse is (-2, -3) and must also be an element of the vector space V. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The dimension of a vector space V is the cardinality. It's usually denoted as superscript, for example, &real;<sup>n</sup>. Let's break down what this looks like:\n",

    "A vector subspace is a subset of a vector space. That subspace is <b>also</b> a vector space, so it follows all the rules we reviewed above. It's also important to note that if W is a linear subspace of V, then the dimension of W must be &le; the dimension of V.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to check whether it's a vector subspace is to check if it's closed under addition and scalar multiplication. Let's go over an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's show that the set V = {(x, y, z) | x, y, z &isin; &real; and x*x = z*z } is <b>not</b> a subspace of &real;<sup>3</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "If V is actually a subspace of &real;<sup>3</sup>, that means it <b>must</b> follow all the properties listed in the beginning of this section. Recall that this is because all subspaces must also be vector spaces. \n",

    "Let's evaluate the first property that stays the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "If vectors u and v &isin; V, then u + v &isin; V\n",
